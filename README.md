# 🤗 Education Toolkit

<aside>

👋 **Welcome!**

We’ve assembled a toolkit that university instructors can use to easily prepare labs, homework, or classes. The content is designed in a self-contained way such that it can easily be incorporated into the existing curriculum. This content is **free** and uses widely known Open Source technologies (`transformers`, `gradio`, etc).

Alternatively, you can request for someone on the Hugging Face team to run the tutorials for your class via the [ML demo.cratization tour](https://www.notion.so/ML-Demo-cratization-tour-with-66847a294abd4e9785e85663f5239652) initiative!

Apart from tutorials, we also share other resources to go further into ML or that can assist in designing course content.

## **Other resources to learn your way!**

### **The 🤗 Course**

We provide a course (free and without ads) that teaches you about natural language processing (NLP) using libraries from the **[Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/)** ecosystem. 

👉 [click here to access the 🤗 Course](https://huggingface.co/course/chapter1/1)

<aside>
💡 This course:

- Requires good knowledge of Python
- Is better taken after an introductory deep learning course, such as **[fast.ai’s](https://www.fast.ai/)** **[Practical Deep Learning for Coders](https://course.fast.ai/)** or one of the programs developed by **[DeepLearning.AI](https://www.deeplearning.ai/)**
- Does not expect prior **[PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)** or **[TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)** knowledge, though some familiarity with either of those will help

### **The 🤗 Book**

<img alt="book-cover" height=200 src="images/book_cover.jpg" id="book-cover"/>

Released February 2022

From experts at Hugging Face, learn all about Transformers and their applications to a wide range of NLP tasks.

<aside>
💡 This book:

- Is written for data scientists and machine learning engineers who may have heard about the recent breakthroughs involving transformers, but are lacking an in-depth guide to help them adapt these models to their own use cases.
- Assumes you have some practical experience with training models on GPUs.
- Does not expect prior **[PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)** or **[TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)** knowledge, though some familiarity with either of those will help
